PROGRAMMING STYLE GUIDE
=======================

Autoconf Files
--------------
(configure.ac, Makefile.am, etc.)

* Indented with hard tabs (autotools fussy about spaces)

Source Files
------------
(*.cpp, *.h)

* Indented with soft tabs (spaces-only)
* Class names are lower-spaced
* Method names are CamelCase'd
* No implementation in header files unless super-simple

Tests
-----
* API tests are written as C++ source files
* Program tests are written in Bash Shell
